    Functions are sometimes called the first class citizens of javascript.
</h3>
<p>
    In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can be passed to other functions,
    returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties. They can also have properties and methods
    just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called.

    <h4>
        Callback functions:
    </h4>
    <p>
        Callbacks are functions that take a function as a parameter.
        For example we can use one when we start a server to show a status message.

                app.listen(8080, () => {
                    console.log("Server is running on port", 8080);
                });
