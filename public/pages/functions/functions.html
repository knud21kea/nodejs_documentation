            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can be passed to other functions,
                returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties. They can also have properties and
                methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called.

                Anonymous functions:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Anonymous functions are functions defined without a specified name. They are often used when a function
                is needed temporarily,
                such as for callbacks or one-time operations. Anonymous functions can be assigned to variables or passed
                as arguments to other functions.

const add = function(x, y) {
    return x + y;

                Arrow functions:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript, introduced in ES6.
                They are especially useful for single line functions and for maintaining the context of the surrounding
                code.

            </h4>
            <p>
                A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.
                They are commonly used in asynchronous programming, event handling,
                and for handling the results of asynchronous operations like fetching data or reading files.
                For example we can use one when we start a server to show a status message.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
const PORT = 8080;
app.listen(PORT, (error) => {
    if (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
    console.log('Server is running on port:', PORT);
});

                Functions in functional programming:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Functions are the key component of functional programming.
                They promote immutability, referential transparency, and composability, which lead to more maintainable
                software.
            </p>
            <h5>
                First-Class and Higher-Order Functions:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values
                from other functions.
                Functions that operate on other functions are called higher-order functions, which enables powerful
                abstractions.

            </p>
            <h5>
                Pure Functions:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions, one that, given the same input,
                will always produce the same output and has no side effects.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Immutability:
            </h5>
            <p>
                In functional programming, data is typically treated as immutable, meaning it cannot be modified after
                creation.
                Functions play a crucial role in creating new data structures or transforming existing ones without
                altering the original data.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Referential Transparency:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Referential transparency is where you can replace a function call with its result without changing the
                program's behavior.
                This property allows for easier optimization, reasoning, and parallelization of code.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Recursion:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Functional programming often relies on recursion instead of loops for iteration. (see 'loops')
                Functions are used to call themselves with modified parameters until a base case is reached.
                This recursive approach is more declarative and aligns well with the functional paradigm.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Function Composition:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Combining simple functions to build more complex ones leads to concise and readable code.
                Complex operations can be coded as a series of function calls.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Higher-Level Abstractions:
            </h5>
            <p>
                JavaScript provide higher-level abstractions such as map, filter, and reduce functions.
                These higher-order functions make it easy to perform common data transformations,
                like mapping over arrays, filtering elements, or aggregating data, in a functional and declarative
                manner.
            </p>
            <h5>
                Concurrency and Parallelism:
            </h5>
            <p>
                Functional programming encourages the use of pure functions, which have no shared state or side effects.
