        'clean' code readability, reusability, professionalism, error catching - again be consistent
        tools examples vsc prettier (which is a linter (eslint)) air b'n'b style

        strict mode (eg reserved keywords)
        Status codes ?? res.status(404).send(.....

        cross site scripting ?? sanitize html ??
        memory bloat, circular dependencies
        how to deal with order of files
        path.resolve gives the absolute path and is independent of OS
        npm sentiment analysis
        "strict mode" revisited global variables
        semantic versioning major.minor.patch
        clean code again, it is a learning goal but not any specific tools professionality Eg prettier ES Lint ? eslint.org
        false 0 (zero) '' or “” (empty string) null undefined NaN are all falsy
