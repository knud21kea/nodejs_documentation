            <p>
                REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a
                standard.
                API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways. In our implementation the request and response
                were in the HTTP:JSON format.

            </h4>
            <p>
                Despite the name, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is language independant and not the same as a
                JavaScript Object.
                JavaScript Objects are simple key-value pairs with no quotes unless there are spaces in the key name,
                but JSON needs quotes to be valid. We can convert between the two.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
JSON.parse(); //Turns a JSON string into an JavaScript object
JSON.stringify(); //Turns a JavaScript object into JSON string/data

                What makes an API Restful?:
            </h4>
            <p>
                In order for an API to be considered RESTful, it has to conform to these criteria:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed
                    through HTTP.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client information is stored between get requests
                    and each request is separate and unconnected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standard form.
                    This requires that:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        resources requested are identifiable and separate from the representations sent to the client.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        resources can be manipulated by the client via the representation they receive because the
                        representation
                        contains enough information to do so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        self-descriptive messages returned to the client have enough information to describe how the
                        client should process it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        hypertext/hypermedia is available, meaning that after accessing a resource the client should be
                        able to use hyperlinks
                        to find all other currently available actions they can take.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    A layered system that organizes each type of server (those responsible for security, load-balancing,
                    etc.)
                    involved in the retrieval of requested information into hierarchies, invisible to the client.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And optionally Code-on-demand: the ability to send executable code from the server to the client
                    when requested,
                    extending client functionality.
                </li>

            <h4>
                Conventions:
            </h4>
            <p>
                We have followed two conventions when designing our API:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Order the endpoints based on HTTP methods,
                    Get, Post, Put(a new resource), Patch(replace parts of a resource), Delete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Name the endpoins with plurals which map to a collection in the domain.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                For example with the mountains API:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
HTTP Method     Endpoint
GET             /mountains
GET             /mountains/:id
POST            /mountains
PUT             /mountains/:id
PATCH           /mountains/:id
PUT             /mountains/:id
DELETE          /mountains/:id
</code></pre>
        </div>
        <div class="pageNavigation">
            <a href="#restapi-section-0" class="pageNavigation">Return to top of page</a>
        </div>

        <div class="subText" id="restapi-section-4">

            <h4>
                Building the APIs endpoints with Express:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Using the Express server we created (see 'nodejs' page) we add routes handling CRUD requests.
                We can make good use of callback functions in the code responsible for handling the requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example with a request to get all mountains:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
app.get("/mountains", (req, res) => {
    res.send({ data: mountains });
});
</code></pre>
            <p>
                And for a request to update the mountain with id passed as path parameter:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
app.use(express.json()); // needed for Express to handle JSON in req.body
..
app.patch("/mountains/:id", (req, res) => {
    let foundIndex = mountains.findIndex((mountain) => mountain.id === Number(req.params.id));
    if (foundIndex === -1) {
        res.status(404).send({ error: `Could not find mountain by id ${req.params.id}` });
    } else {
        mountains[foundIndex] = { ...mountains[foundIndex], ...req.body, id: Number(req.params.id) };
        res.send({ data: mountains[foundIndex] });
    }
});
 </code></pre>
            <p>
                For more info on the advantages of findIndex() and ... (spread) see the 'loops' page.
