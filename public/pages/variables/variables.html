	Variables and data types

	<h3>
		To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
	</h3>
	<p>
		&emsp;We will look at data types and type coercion in JavaScript. 'var' can be used to specify the data type,
		but we try to minimise its use as it has global scope which can be difficult to debug.<br>
		&emsp;We use 'const' as much as possible, which does need to be assigned a value when declared
		and otherwise 'let' for local variables with changing values.<br>

	<h4>
		Data types:
	</h4>
	<p>
		There are 8 data types in javascript
	<ul>
		<li>String - represents sequence of characters</li>
		<li>Number - represents numeric values</li>
		<li>Bigint - represents integers with arbitrary magnitude</li>
		<li>Boolean - represents boolean value</li>
		<li>Undefined - represents undefined value</li>
		<li>Null - represents no value</li>
		<li>Symbol - is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property</li>
		<li>Object (object, array, date) - the only mutable values. Functions are also objects</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Although they seem similar, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object .
		JavaScript usually defaults to undefined when something is devoid of a value:

	<h4>
		Dynamic and weak typing:
	</h4>
	<p>
		JavaScript which is a dynamic language with dynamic types.
		Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type
		and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.
	</p>
	<pre>
        <code>
		let myVariable = 7; // myVariable is now a number
		myVariable = "a prime number"; // myVariable is now a string
		myVariable = true; // myVariable is now a boolean
        </code>
    </pre>
	<p>
		JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion
		when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.
	</p>
	<pre>
        <code>
		const myVariable = 7; // a number
		const result = myVariable + "1"; // JavaScript coerces myVariable to a string
		console.log(result); // "71"
        </code>
    </pre>

	<h4>
		Type coercion:
	</h4>
	<p>
		JavaScript is a weakly typed language. This means that you can often use a value of one type where another type is expected,
		and the language will convert it to the right type for you. To do so, JavaScript defines coercion rules.
	<ul>
		<li>Primitive coercion - where a primitive value is expected, but no strong preference for the actual type</li>
		<li>Numeric coercion - bigint, number</li>
		<li>Other coercions - string, boolean, object</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The details of coercion rules are beyond the scope of this document.<br>
