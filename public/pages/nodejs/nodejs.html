                Node is neither a framework nor a programming language.
            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;It is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. We have used it together
                with Express, which is an OpenJS Foundation project providing a Web Application Framework for Node.

            <h4>
                To set up Node for a JavaScript project using Express:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Install Node. Navigate to the root directory of the project (see the page on terminal operations).
                Create a package.json file with a key "dependencies" taking a value object with key "express" and value
                "version"
            </p>
            <pre><code>
{
    "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.18.2"
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                We can then use Node's package manager to install the dependencies.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
>npm i
</code></pre>
            <p>
                This creates and poulates a node_modules folder in the project. This folder should not be push to Git.
                A package-lock.json file is also created. This file ensures that the same dependencies,
                with the same versions, are installed consistently across different environments.

                Creating a server instance:
            </h4>
            <p>
                We are using Express to help build our web application, and that framework expects the entry point
                to be app.js, so we create that file in the root of our project. To get the server running we need to
                import
                Express, initialise it and set a port address for the server to listen on.
                8080 is conventionally the development port for http.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
 ...   
app.listen(8080, (error) => {
    if (error) {
        return;
}});
</code></pre>
            <p>
                There are no routes here but the server is running.
                For more information on alternative import methods see the 'modules' page.
                And for more on program design and structure see 'design'.
