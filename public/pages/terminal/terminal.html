            <p>
                &emsp;We still use a Command Line Interface (CLI) both as input to and output from console applications
                and to configure or control other software. We can also navigate our folder structure and
                perform maintanence on the operating system. The commands are entered after a command prompt,
                usually a character like '>' or '$'.<br>
                &emsp;This works as a Read - Evaluate - Print - Loop (REPL), effectively a console window where
                a single expression is inputed and a result returned.<br>
                &emsp;Pressing tab in the terminal helps with auto completion of commands and avoids errors.

            <p>
                &ensp;We use the terminal to run node programs too. NPM is a package manager for node modules,
                and Nodemon is a command-line tool that helps to optimise development of Node.js applications.
                It monitors the project directory and automatically restarts the application when it detects any
                changes. This can save time in development, but can have issues when a file shared by both client
                and server is edited, where the browser reload can be too fast for the server restart, giving 404.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
>npm init                   | set up a new or existing npm package
>npm install                | cleans up and installs dependencies
>npm install --save-exact   | generates the package-lock.js in an Express project
>npm i                      | the same as npm install
>node filename              | run a node application
