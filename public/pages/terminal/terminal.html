<h2>Terminal operations</h2>

<div class="introText">
    <h3>
        Originally computers only accepted inputs from and printed outputs to a terminal.
    </h3>
    <p>
        &emsp;We still use a Command Line Interface (CLI) both as input to and output from console applications
        and to configure or control other software. We can also navigate our folder structure and
        perform maintanence on the operating system. The commands are entered after a command prompt,
        usually a character like '>'.<br>
        &emsp;This works as a Read - Evaluate - Print - Loop (REPL), effectively a console window where
        a single expression is inputed and a result returned.<br>
        &emsp;Pressing tab in the terminal helps with auto completion of commands and avoids errors.

    <h4>
        Some common commands:
    </h4>
    <p>
        These are used to manage files and navigate folder structures or to get system information.
        Other useful commands are open, cp, mv, touch, mkdir, rmdir, sudo, top, q, clear, ditto, exit.

        >cd ..                      | change directory up one level
        >pwd                        | print path of working directory    
        >ls "path"                  | list directory (ls -l for details)

        Working with git:
    </h4>
    <p>
        We can also get access to source and version control features directly from the terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
    <pre>
        <code>
	    >git add -A                 | adds all files even those outside the current directory
	    >git commit -m "message"    | stash all changes on current branch
	    >git push                   | commits from local to remote repo
	    >git clone "url"            | copy a repo to a new directory
        </code>

    <h4>
        Controlling node:
    </h4>
    <p>
        We use the terminal to run node programs too. NPM is a package manager for node modules,
        and Nodemon is a command-line tool that helps to optimise development of Node.js applications.
        It monitors the project directory and automatically restarts the application when it detects any changes.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
	    >npm i                      | cleans up and installs dependencies. The same as npm install
	    >node filename              | run a node application
	    >nodemon filename           | run a node application with Nodemon
	    >Ctrl+C                     | twice to exit
	    >Ctrl+D                     | hard exit	    
        </code>
