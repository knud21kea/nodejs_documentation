            <p>
                &emsp;We still use a Command Line Interface (CLI) both as input to and output from console applications
                and to configure or control other software. We can also navigate our folder structure and
                perform maintanence on the operating system. The commands are entered after a command prompt,
                usually a character like '>'.<br>
                &emsp;This works as a Read - Evaluate - Print - Loop (REPL), effectively a console window where
                a single expression is inputed and a result returned.<br>
                &emsp;Pressing tab in the terminal helps with auto completion of commands and avoids errors.

                These are used to manage files and navigate folder structures or to get system information.
                Other useful commands are open, cp, mv, touch, mkdir, rmdir, sudo, top, q, clear, ditto, exit.

                We can also get access to source and version control features directly from the terminal.

            <pre><code>
>git add -A                 | adds files from all directories
>git commit -m "message"    | stash all changes on current branch
>git push                   | commits from local to remote repo

            <p>
                We use the terminal to run node programs too. NPM is a package manager for node modules,
                and Nodemon is a command-line tool that helps to optimise development of Node.js applications.
                It monitors the project directory and automatically restarts the application when it detects any
                changes.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
>npm install        | cleans up and installs dependencies
>npm i              | The same as npm install
>node filename      | run a node application
>nodemon filename   | run a node application with Nodemon
>Ctrl+C             | twice to exit
>Ctrl+D             | hard exit
