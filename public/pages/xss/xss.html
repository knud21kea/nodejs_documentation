        How to combat an XXS attack?
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are basically two strategies, both of which need to be implemented.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Input validation is performed to make sure only secure data enters an information system
            </li>
            <li>
                Output encoding translates untrusted input into a safe model, which can be done by sanitizing HTML.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side sanitization: prevents unsafe content from the DOM level
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side sanitization: prevents the storage of malicious HTML content in databases
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
