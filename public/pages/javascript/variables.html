			<h3>
				To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
			</h3>
			<p>
				&emsp;We will look at data types and type coercion in JavaScript. 'var' can be used to specify the data
				type,
				but we try to minimise its use as it has global scope which can be difficult to debug due to
				hoisting.<br>
				&emsp;Scope is an important concept. Opening a scope pushes a call execution stack and local variables
				which are then popped outside the scope. Block scoping gives more granular control of scope than
				function scoping.<br>
				&emsp;We use 'const' as much as possible, which does need to be assigned a value when declared
				and otherwise 'let' for local variables with changing values. A const cannot be redeclared,
				but an array can be changed, for example by pushing an element, and an object's properties can be
				changed.<br>

			<h4>
				Data types:
			</h4>
			<p>
				There are 8 data types in javascript
			<ul>
				<li>String - represents sequence of characters</li>
				<li>Number - represents numeric values</li>
				<li>Bigint - represents integers with arbitrary magnitude</li>
				<li>Boolean - represents boolean value</li>
				<li>Undefined - represents undefined value</li>
				<li>Null - represents no value</li>
				<li>Symbol - is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property
				</li>
				<li>Object (object, array, date) - the only mutable values. Functions are also objects</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Although they seem similar, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence
				of an object .
				JavaScript usually defaults to undefined when something is devoid of a value. You can find type using
				typeof().
			</p>
			<pre><code>
const value = true;
console.log(typeof(value));
</code></pre>

			<h4>
				Dynamic types:
			</h4>
			<p>
				JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types.
				Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type
				and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.
			</p>
			<pre><code>
let myVariable = 7; // myVariable is now a number
myVariable = "a prime number"; // myVariable is now a string
myVariable = true; // myVariable is now a boolean
</code></pre>
			<div class="pageNavigation">

			</div>

		<section class="subText" id="section-3">

			<h4>
				Weak typing and type coercion:
			</h4>
			<p>
				It is also a weakly typed language. This means that you can often use a value of one type where another
				type is expected,
				and the language will convert it to the right type for you, instead of throwing type errors. This is
				type coercion.
			</p>
			<pre><code>
const myVariable = 7; // a number
const result = myVariable + "1"; // JavaScript coerces myVariable to a string
console.log(result); // "71"
</code></pre>
			<p>
				When comparing data the == operator performs a loose check with type coercion, while === requires
				identical type.
			</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript defines coercion rules:
			<ul>
				<li>Primitive coercion - where a primitive value is expected, but no strong preference for the actual
					type;</li>
				<li>Numeric coercion - bigint, number;</li>
				<li>Other coercions - string, boolean, object.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The details of coercion rules are beyond the scope of this document.<br>
