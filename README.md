Full stack application serving multiple static HTML pages using Express

All content @author Graham Heaven

app.js is formated with Eslint using AirBnB style.

- App uses SSR so pages can only be fetched by clicking an anchor in the top menu.
- The menu displays icons, but hovering shows a pop up wuth the page topic, if it is not clear.
- On each page it is possible to navigate to sections and back to start using the navigation side panel.
- Clicking admin without being logged in redirects server side to login.
- Succesful log in redirects server side to simple admin page.
